<h4><a name="maintenance"></a>ELEVATOR MAINTENANCE</h4>

<img src="services_files/hm1.jpg" alt="Elevator Maintenance" border="0" height="149" width="195">

<p>Careful and consistent maintenance improves the long-term 
reliability, safety and efficiency of your elevators. At Broward 
Elevator &amp; Lift, we will maintain your elevators on a monthly basis,
 including cleaning and lubricating parts, testing the telephone and 
alarm bell and examining all elevator equipment to ensure it is safe and
 operating properly. </p>
  
<p>Our full-service maintenance contract guarantees that you pay <strong>one monthly fee</strong> in exchange for <strong>monthly maintenance of your elevators PLUS service calls and repairs</strong>. If an elevator breaks down and needs service between monthly visits, we <strong>make the repairs at no additional cost to you</strong>.</p> 
  
<p>Insuring your elevators with a full-service maintenance contract 
means you avoid the expense of major elevator repairs, as well as the 
liability of accidents.</p>

<p>We maintain all types of elevator equipment for all makes and models 
of elevators, including those manufactured by the major elevator 
companies: Otis, Schindler, ThyssenKrupp and KONE.</p>
  
<p>Broward Elevator &amp; Lift offers both a full-service maintenance 
contract, as well as a limited maintenance contract for residential and 
commercial customers in Palm Beach, Broward, Miami Dade, and Monroe 
County in South Florida.</p>
  
 <h5>Full Service Maintenance Contract</h5>
 
<ul>
     <li>Monthly preventative maintenance visits </li>
     <li>Service, repair and replacement of parts as stated in contract</li> 
     <li>Service calls during normal business hours (8 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.) </li>
     <li>Overtime callbacks may be included or billed separately </li>
     <li>Safety tests required by State of Florida</li>
</ul>
  
<h5> Limited Maintenance Contract </h5>

<ul>
     <li>Monthly or quarterly maintenance visits</li>
    <li>All repairs and service calls billed separately</li>
</ul>  


<h5>Consistency = Reliability</h5>
  
<p>Many times the company that installed the elevator is not the right 
company to be maintaining the elevator. The big companies do a good job 
installing elevators because that is their expertise, but often fall 
short in servicing them. At Broward Elevator &amp; Lift, we earn your 
trust by doing what we promise. That means showing up every month to 
service and maintain your elevators. </p>
  
<p>But it’s more than that. Whenever possible, <strong>the same technician will service your elevators each month</strong>.
 Having someone who is familiar with your equipment service it every 
month, instead of a new person each time, leads to consistency and 
reliability. And you’ll always know when we’ve been there. Our 
technicians will check in with a designated manager when they arrive and
 when they leave. If a manager is not on site, we’ll leave a ticket in 
the elevator machine room. Plus, we’ll send an email notification of 
service and maintenance calls detailing the work that was performed.</p>
  
<h5>Surprisingly Affordable Service</h5>
  
<p>You might think that smaller elevator companies charge more for 
service than the big companies, right? Wrong! Because we have less 
overhead and marketing expenses, Broward Elevator &amp; Lift is 
typically <strong>20% or more less expensive</strong> than many of our larger competitors. <strong>Better service at a better price</strong>…talk about getting more for your money!</p>
  
<p>We service residential and commercial elevators throughout South 
Florida, including Palm Beach, Broward, Miami Dade and Monroe County. 
For dependable, preventative elevator maintenance at a surprisingly 
affordable cost, contact Broward Elevator &amp; Lift today.<strong> Call 954-491-8161 or <a href="http://www.browardelevator.com/contact.html">contact us</a> for a free service maintenance contract estimate.</strong></p>

<h4><a name="repair"></a>ELEVATOR REPAIR</h4>
  
<img src="services_files/hm2.jpg" alt="Elevator Repair" border="0" height="149" width="195">
<p>Did your elevator stop working? Just before the morning rush? Call 
Broward Elevator &amp; Lift for fast, reliable repair service. Our 
Certified Elevator Technicians will diagnose the problem and repair your
 elevator in an efficient and cost-effective manner.</p> 
  
<p>At Broward Elevator &amp; Lift, we realize that any downtime for your elevators is inconvenient. That’s why <strong>we keep an extensive inventory of critical replacement parts on hand at all times.</strong>
 And if we don’t have a part necessary to make a repair, we can get most
 elevator parts the same day or overnight. Our goal is to minimize 
downtime and get your elevator back in safe working condition as quickly
 as possible.</p> 
  
<p>When you call Broward Elevator &amp; Lift during regular business 
hours (Monday – Friday, 8 a.m. – 4:30 p.m.), you’ll speak to a customer 
representative in our Ft. Lauderdale office; you’ll never get an 
automated phone menu or be sent to a far-away call center.<strong> We also provide emergency elevator service 24/7.</strong>
 If you call with an emergency after hours during the week or on 
weekends, your call will be forwarded to a manager immediately and you 
will receive a call back within minutes.</p>
  
<p>If you have a full-service monthly maintenance contract with Broward 
Elevator &amp; Lift, elevator repairs and equipment replacement for 
service calls between monthly visits are included in the monthly fee.</p>
  
<p>If you’re in Palm Beach, Broward, Miami Dade or Monroe County in 
South Florida and need reliable elevator repairs at a reasonable price, 
call Broward Elevator &amp; Lift at <strong>954-491-8161 or <a href="http://www.browardelevator.com/contact.html">contact us</a> for a free repair estimate</strong>.</p>
  
 <p class="top">[<a href="#tp">back to top</a>]</p>
  
<h4><a name="modernization"></a>ELEVATOR UPGRADE AND MODERNIZATION</h4>
  
<img src="services_files/hm3.jpg" alt="Elevator Modernization" border="0" height="149" width="195">
<p>If you’ve considered upgrading or modernizing your elevators but haven’t taken the leap yet, ask yourself these questions:</p> 
<ul>
     <li>Do your elevators break down often? </li>
     <li>Do they look old and outdated? </li>
     <li>Do they comply with current code and safety standards? </li>
     <li>Have passengers complained about the wait time, ride quality or strange noises?</li>
</ul>  

<p>If you answered “yes” to any of these, it’s time to modernize. One 
benefit of elevator modernization is improving the performance, 
appearance and safety of your elevators. Another benefit of 
modernization is that it keeps older buildings competitive with newer 
buildings and increases the value of your building. For these reasons, <strong>elevator modernization typically provides a good return on investment</strong>.</p>
  
<p> Broward Elevator &amp; Lift specializes in elevator upgrades and 
modernization. Whether you’re looking to make a few cosmetic changes or 
you want to completely strip out and replace the elevator interior 
and/or equipment, Broward Elevator &amp; Lift can perform your elevator 
upgrade or modernization. What’s more, <strong>we can usually do the job at a much lower cost than our competitors</strong>!</p>
  
<p>Major elevator modifications typically only happen every 25 to 30 
years. That’s why it’s critically important to do it right. Based on a 
full inspection of your elevator equipment, Broward Elevator &amp; Lift 
will develop a detailed analysis and recommendations for what you should
 include in your modernization project. Having managed multi-million 
dollar modernization projects for large elevator companies, you can be 
assured <strong>we have the knowledge and experience to perform the job on time and within budget</strong>.</p> 
  
<p>If you’re ready to enjoy the benefits of a new elevator without the expense, contact Broward Elevator &amp; Lift today. <strong>Call us at 954-491-8161 or <a href="http://www.browardelevator.com/contact.html">contact us</a> to analyze and quote your modernization project</strong>.</p>
  
 <p class="top">[<a href="#tp">back to top</a>]</p>
  
<h4><a name="newinstallation"></a>NEW AND CUSTOM ELEVATOR INSTALLATION</h4>
  
<p>Broward Elevator &amp; Lift can install both standard and 
custom-engineered elevators in new or existing buildings. Smaller 
elevator companies such as Broward Elevator are particularly suited for 
custom installations, i.e., elevators that fall outside the specs of 
standard, pre-engineered elevators. This often includes elevators that 
are larger or smaller than normal, those that have a custom interior or 
new elevators installed in an existing building. </p> 

<p>If you would like an estimate for your new or custom elevator installation, <strong>call Broward Elevator &amp; Lift at 954-491-8161 or <a href="http://www.browardelevator.com/contact.html">contact us</a> to discuss your project</strong>.</p>
  
 <p class="top">[<a href="#tp">back to top</a>]</p>
  
<h4><a name="safety"></a>ELEVATOR SAFETY TESTS AND CERTIFICATION</h4>
  
<p>Is your elevator certified or up to code? The State of Florida 
requires that all elevators meet certain safety criteria (telephone, 
door locking mechanism, proper Braille, door protection, etc). Broward 
Elevator &amp; Lift is your local authority regarding the requirements 
to have your elevator annually certified in Palm Beach, Broward, Miami 
Dade and Monroe County. We always stay updated about the latest changes,
 and we’re highly experienced in getting customers through the 
inspection and certification renewal process quickly and on time.</p> 
  
<p>The following safety tests are required by the State of Florida and included in our full-service maintenance contract:</p>

<ul>
     <li>Annual No load Governor Safety Tests for Traction Elevators (1002.1 A17.1).</li>
    <li>Five-Year Full Load Governor Safety Tests for Traction Elevators (1002.3 A17.1).</li>
    <li>Annual Hydraulic Pressure Test for Hydraulic elevators (1004 A17.1).</li>
    <li>Normal and Final Terminal Stopping Devices (1002.2E A17.1).</li>
    <li>Oil Buffer Test (1002.2A A17.1).</li>
    <li>Power Operation of Door System (1002.2H A17.1).</li>
</ul>
  
<p>In Florida, recent changes in the law require certain repairs and 
upgrades be made to elevators to comply with current codes and safety 
standards. Broward Elevator &amp; Lift will be happy to inspect your 
elevator, provide an estimate and perform these repairs for those who do
 not have an elevator maintenance contract.</p>
  
<p>To find out if your elevator needs repairs to bring it up to code, or if you need help with the elevator certification process, <strong>call Broward Elevator &amp; Lift at 954-491-8161 or <a href="http://www.browardelevator.com/contact.html">contact us</a> today</strong>.</p>
  
 <p class="top">[<a href="#tp">back to top</a>]</p>
  
<h4><a name="lifts"></a>INSTALLATION AND SERVICE OF LIFTS</h4>
  
<p>Broward Elevator &amp; Lift also installs and services all types of 
lifts, including wheelchair lifts, home lifts, stair chairs and 
dumbwaiters. If your residence or commercial business needs a particular
 type of lift installed, <strong>call us at 954-491-8161 for a free estimate or <a href="http://www.browardelevator.com/contact.html">contact us</a> for more information</strong>.</p>
